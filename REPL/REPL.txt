REPL:
*Read-Eval-Print Loop in JavaScript is an interactive programming environment where you can write and execute JavaScript code in real-time.
*It reads the input, evaluates the JavaScript code, prints the result, and then loops back to allow more input. 
->Features of REPL:-
    *Immediate Feedback: You see the result of your code right after entering it.
    *Multiline Input: You can enter complex multi-line statements by pressing Shift+Enter.
