Prototypes: 
*A prototype in JavaScript is an object from which other objects inherit properties and methods. 
*Every JavaScript object has a prototype, which acts as a template for the object.

    Example:

        function Person(name, age) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }

        Person.prototype.sayHello = function() {
            console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
        };

        const person1 = new Person("Likith", 25);`
        person1.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, my name is Likith

        const person2 = new Person("Bharath", 30);
        person2.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, my name is Bharath
