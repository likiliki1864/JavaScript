IIFE:
*An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that is defined and executed immediately after its creation.

    Syntax:
        (function() {
        // Code here runs immediately
        console.log("This is an IIFE");
    })();

    Example:
        (function(name) {
            console.log("Hello, " + name);
        })("World");
