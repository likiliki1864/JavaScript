Async:
*An Async function is a function that always returns a Promise.
*If the function returns a value, the Promise is resolved with that value.
*If the function throws an exception or returns an error, the Promise is rejected.

Await:
*The await keyword can only be used inside an async function.
*It pauses the execution of the function until the promise is resolved or rejected.
*While the function is waiting, other code continues to run.
*Once the promise resolves, the result is assigned to the variable.

    Syntax:
        async function myFunction() {
        let result = await somePromise;  // Waits until the promise resolves
        console.log(result);  // Executes after the promise is resolved
        }


    Example:
        function fetchData() {
        return new Promise((resolve) => {
            setTimeout(() => {
            resolve("Data fetched!");
            }, 2000);  // Simulate a 2-second network request
        });
        }

        async function getData() {
        console.log("Fetching data...");
        
        let result = await fetchData();  // Wait until fetchData resolves
        console.log(result);  // Output: Data fetched!
        }

        getData();  // Output: Fetching data...
                    // After 2 seconds: Data fetched!
